## Exercise 1

```python
lst = range(0, 101, 2)

with open("ex1.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("\n".join([str(x) for x in lst]))
```


## Exercise 2

```python
with open("ex2.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(",".join([str(x) for x in lst]))
```


## Exercise 3

```{python}
with open("sowpods.txt") as f:
    for _ in range(6):  # skip the first 6 lines
        f.readline()
    counter = 0
    for line in f:
        if len(line.strip()) > 0:  # there are empty lines in the file
            counter += 1

print(f"There are {counter} words in the Scrabble list.")
```


## Exercise 4

```{python}
with open("sowpods.txt") as f:
    for _ in range(6):  # skip the first 6 lines
        f.readline()
    counter = 0
    for line in f:
        if len(line.strip()) > 14:
            counter += 1
            # print(line.strip())  # print words with 15+ letters

print(f"There are {counter} words with 15+ letters in the Scrabble list.")
```

If you want to print the words that have 15 or more letters, you can uncomment the corresponding line (i.e., remove the `#`).
